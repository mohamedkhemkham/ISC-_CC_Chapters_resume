Understand computer Networking
	
	#what is Networking:	
		a network is simply two or more computers linked together to share data.
		#Types of Network:
			-->Local Area Network(LAN):
				typically network that span a single floor or building.

			-->Wide Area Network(WAN):
				long distance connection between geographically remote networks
		
		#Network Devices:
			-Hub:
				connect multiple devices in a network, boradcastin data to all devices (less smart).
			-Switch:
				known as intelligent hub, switches can route traffic to specific port/device in a network.
			-Router:
				used to route traffic flow on networks, better than the siwtches routers can determine the most efficient "route"(~path).
			-Firewall:
				manage and control network traffic and protect the network by filtering the traffic based on a set of defined rules.
			-Server:
				a computer that provides information to other computers(ex: web servers).
			-Endpoint:
				it is the end of a communication link.One end is at the server and the other end is a client computer trying to make request to use the server.

		#Other Terms:
			-Ethernet:
				(IEEE 802.3) is a standard that defines wired connectoins of networked devices.
			-Device Address:
				*Media Access Control (MAC):
					every network device is assigned a MAC address made of 6 bytes where the first 3 denote the vendor ,no two devices can have the same MAC address on the same network.
				*Internet Protocol(IP):
					a logical address that is used for communication ,it represent a network interface within the network.
