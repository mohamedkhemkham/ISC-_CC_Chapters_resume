Understand computer Networking
	
	#what is Networking:	
		a network is simply two or more computers linked together to share data.
		#Types of Network:
			-->Local Area Network(LAN):
				typically network that span a single floor or building.

			-->Wide Area Network(WAN):
				long distance connection between geographically remote networks
		
		#Network Devices:
			-Hub:
				connect multiple devices in a network, boradcastin data to all devices (less smart).
			-Switch:
				known as intelligent hub, switches can route traffic to specific port/device in a network.
			-Router:
				used to route traffic flow on networks, better than the siwtches routers can determine the most efficient "route"(~path).
			-Firewall:
				manage and control network traffic and protect the network by filtering the traffic based on a set of defined rules.
			-Server:
				a computer that provides information to other computers(ex: web servers).
			-Endpoint:
				it is the end of a communication link.One end is at the server and the other end is a client computer trying to make request to use the server.

		#Other Terms:
			-Ethernet:
				(IEEE 802.3) is a standard that defines wired connectoins of networked devices.
			-Device Address:
				*Media Access Control (MAC):
					every network device is assigned a MAC address made of 6 bytes where the first 3 denote the vendor ,no two devices can have the same MAC address on the same network.
				*Internet Protocol(IP):
					a logical address that is used for communication ,it represent a network interface within the network.

	#Networking Models:	
		every goal of all communication is to share and exchange information ,those goals can be expressed in network as :
			-provide relaible communication between hosts
			-isolate function is layers
			-use packet as the basis of communication
			-standardize routing,addressing and control
			-allow layers beyong internetworking to add functionality
			-be scalable and resilient

			A network model should have at least two layers(upper one and lower one)
	
	#Open System Interconnection(OSI)model:
		it is an absrtact framework or theoretical model for how protocols should function.
		consisting of 7 layers referred to them either by name (ex:transprt layer)or by number(ex:layer 4).
		layers (5-7) are referred to as Data, each layer has the potential of encapsulation which is adding headers and possibly footers by a protocol.
		encapsulation occurs when data is moving down the model, where the inverse(de-encapsulation) happens when data is moving upward.

	#Transmition Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP):
		the TCP/IP protocol stack is the first networking model for networking consistin :
			-application layer
			-transport layer
			-internet layer
			-network interface layer
		at the application layer protocols include : telnet,FTP,SMTP,DNS
		the primary transport protocols used are :TCP,UDP
		in the internet layer the ICMP

	#Internet Protocol(IPv4,IPv6):
		IP is deployed in two main version IPv4 with 32-bit address space and IPv6 with 128-bit address space.
		to ease network administration network is devided into subnets,for distinguishing a subnet mask is used to define the part of the address used for the subnet.
		IPv6 is a modernization of IPv4 eleminating major weaknesses:
			-much larger address field.
			-improved security, IPsec is mandatory.
			-improved quiality of service.

	#WIFI:
		wireless networking, so systems are not tied to a cable and roam freely in the range of the wifi.

	#Security of network:
		TCP/IP vulnerability are numerous, improper implemented TCP/IP stack are vulnerable to many attacks such:
			-DoS/DDoS : 
				the prevention of authorized access to resources or 			delaying of time-critical responses for operation
			-Fragment attack:
				the attacker framgents the traffic in a way that is unreadable by the system.
			-oversized packet attack:
				purposly sending a packet that is bigger than the expected causing system failure.
			-spoofing attack:
				faking the sending address of a transmision to gain access into a system.
			-Man-In-The-Middle (MITM)attack :
				the attacker position himself between the sender and the system so he can intercept and alter data traveling.

	#Ports and Protocols :
		-physical Ports:
			the pots on the routers,switches,servers,computers, that you connect to using wires to make a network
		-logical Ports:
			logical port or 'socket' is an address number that both ends agree to comunicate through.
			ports allow a single ip address to support multiple communication at the same time, each using different port number.
			data types are mapped using port number associated with services, ex:
			web http is 80,https is 443.
			Ports numbers:
				(0-1023):well known or common protocols like DNS,TCP/IP,SMTP... .
				(1024-49151):registred ports ,associated with proprietary
