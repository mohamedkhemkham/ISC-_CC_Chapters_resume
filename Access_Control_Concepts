Understand Access Controls Consepts :
		
		#Acees controls revolves around limiting what object to be accessed by what subject according to what rules .

		#Controls overview :
			controls is about granting the appropriate level of access to authorized personnel and denying it for unauthorized ones,
			Acess is based on three elements:
				
				-->Subject : any entity that request access to our assets, the entity maybe a user,program,process... ,a subject is 'Active' if it initiates a request for access.
				
				-->Object : anything a subject want to access like a device,process,server... ,when taknig no requests an object is called 'Passive'.
				
				-->Ruels : a rule is an instruction developed to allow or deny access by comparing the validated identitiy of the subject against an Access Control List (ACL).

		#Control Assessment :
			eveluating what level of access an object requires therfore applying the correct level of access it needs .

		#Defense in Depth : 
			an information security strategy that integrates people,technology and operation capabilities to establish variable barriers across multiple layers and missions of the organization.

		#Least Privilege :
			it means every user get access to only information he need and no more .
		
		#Privileged Access management:
			its about not assigning a privilege in a static way but only when that user with that role request an access he will be granted the privlilege otherwise no.
		
		#Privileged Acounts :
			privileged acounts are those with permissions beyond those normal acounts such as managers and administrators.

		#Segregation of Duties :
			also known as separartion of duties,stands that no one person should control an entire high-risk transaction from start to finish.
			one implementation of it is the dual control ex:at the bank the volts locks have multiple keys that should be present at the same time to open them each key with the position of different members .

			-->two person integrity : at least two persons should be present in the area .
		
		#Authorized vs Unauthorized personnel:
			subjects are authorized access to objects after authentication .
			authentication is done by comparing the presented data with the one in the access control list or matrix.

Physical Access Control :
	Items that you can physically touch, inclusing physical mechanisms deployed as an access control ,ex: security guards,fences,motion detectors ,gates ... .
	this kind of controls aims at first to protect the most valiable asset which is humans then the security of other objects .

	#types of physical controls :
		-->Badge systems and Gates entry:
			any mechanism such as turnstiles,mantraps for human traffic or remote locked doors.
		
		-->Environmental Design :
			CPTED:crime prevention through environmental design , tries to develope a safer workspaces through passive design elements .
		
		-->Biometrics :  
			to authenticate a user's identity ,biometrics uses characterstics unique to the individual seeking access ,it has two processes:
				-Enrollement : register your biometric data 
				-verification :user present the biometric data then it can be compared to the stored one .

	#Monitoring :
		the use of physical access and monitoring personnel and equipment entering and leaving as well as auditing/logging ex: Cameras,Gurad,Alarms,Logs... .

Understand Logical Access Controls:
	Electronic Controls to prevent access to systems 

	#Types of logical controls :
		-passwords
		-badges/token readers connectes to a system
		-Biometrics

	#Descretionary Access Control :
		an access conrol policy that is enforced over all objects and subjects in an information system.
			-->when a subject is granted access to the system it can do :
				-Pass the information to other subjects,objects
				-Grant its privileges to other subjects
				-Change security attributes on subjects,objects,systems ..
				-Choose the security attributes to be assigned to new subjects.
				-Change the rules governing access controls.

	#Mandatory Access Control :
		Only properly designated security admins,as trusted subjects,can modify any of the security rules that are established for subjects and objects.
		with this in action a subject can't do any of the actions listed above

	#Role Based Access Control :
		simply giving access based on the subject role ,ex:only HR have access to personnel information .
