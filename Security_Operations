Understand Data Securtiy
		
		#Data Handling:
			data itself has a life cycel that it goes through from construction to its destruction :
			-->create : creating the knowledge 
			-->Store : storing or recording it in some fashion 
			-->Use : using this knowledge (may be update it) 
			-->Share : share the data with others.
			-->archive: archive it when its not temporarily needed
			-->Destroy: destroy the data when its no longer needed

		#Data Handling Practices :
			data has value and it should be handled properly , so first it should be classified:
			-->classification:
				this classification should dectate rules and restriction about how this information should be used,stored,shared with others.
				Labeling and handel the inforamtion according to the organizational impacts of this information on its CIA

			-->Labeling :
				Security labels are part of implementing controls to protect classified information with a simple way of organizing from low to high .ex: highly restricted : for very sensitive data ,low sensitivity: compromised data with this level could cause minor delays or distruptions... .

			-->Retention :
				Information should be kept as long as it has value .Thus retention periods should be detremined .
				Records Retention :
					policies indicate how long an organization is required to maintain information and assets guarantig that :
						-personnel understand various retention requirements 
						-retention requirements for each information type should be appropriatly documented 
						-system,processes,individuals should retain information according to the required schedule.

			-->Destruction:
				Data remaining on a media after deleting called remanence which is a security concern, to reduce this danger :
					-clear the device or the system , envlolving writing multipe random data over and over (overwirting,zerowriting).
					-purging the device or the system physically to reduce the 'ghost' data left especailly the magnetic devices ,for that degaussing is more effective.
					-physically destruction of the device is the ultimate remedy of data remanence .

		#Logging and Monitoring Security Events :
			capturing signals generated by events,Events are any action that take place within the systems environment and cause measurable or observal change in one or more element or resource within the system.
			inforamtion maybe be relevant to being recorded and reviewed include:
				-user ID
				-system activities
				-dates/times of key event(login & logout) 
				-device and loctaion identity
				-successful and rejected system and resources access attempts
				-system configuration changes and system protection activation/des

		#Data Security Event Ex:
			event,event details,raw log
				[raw log image]

		#Event logging best practices:
			Different tools are used depending on the attack traffic(coming in or going out).
			-Ingress Monitoring :
				surveillance and assessment of all inbound communications traffic and access attempts,for this most used devices,systems:
					-firewalls
					-gateways
					-Remote authentication servers
					-IDS/IPS tools
					-SIEM solutions
					-Anti-malware solutions
			-Engress Monitoring :
				regulating data leaving the organization's IT environment,the term Data Loss Preventioin(DLP)is used with the engress monitoring also called data leak prevention,when the DLP deployed it should inspect :
					-Emails (content and attachment)
					-copy of portable media
					-File Transport protocol(FTP)
					-posting to web pages/sites
					-Application Programming Interface (APIs)

		#Encryption overview:
			Cryptography is all around us , its used to protect information by keeping its meaning secret to someone who doesn't have a way to decrypt it (unlock),objective of encryption is to transform the plaintext the original data to a secret on called ciphertext.
			with the use of Cryptography:
				-Confidentiality: by hiding the information so it cannot be understood by anyone else but the intended recipient.
				-Integrity : using hash functions and digital signatures provide the integirty for verifying the content of the data and its not been altered in any way

			-Encryption system :
				is the set of hardware,softawre,algorithms... that provide a set of encryption services.

			-Plaintext: 
				a data in its normal,unencrypted format,a plaintext can be :
					-image,audio,video files in their raw/compressed formats
					-human-readable texts,numeric data with/without markup language elements for metadata.
					-database files or records
					-anything else it can be represented in a digital form 

			#Symmetric Encryption:
				the main characteristic is that it uses the same key for both encryption and decryption.
				downsides:
					-key distribution : the use of an out-of-band key distribution is mandatory to prevent 'Man In The Middle'attacks .
					-any party with the knowledge of the key can access/change the messages .
					-scalability : each individual wish to connect needs a new pair of keys =>number of keys grows rapidly .

			#Asymmetric Encryption:
				using one key to encrypt and another key to decrypt(privat/public)keys.
				this pair of keys should be generated wher the public is available publicly so anyone can encrypt a message using this key and only the recipient has the private key to decrypt the message this will reduce the scalability of making keys.
				downsides:
					the calculation of the decryption and encryption is very slow compared to symmetric ,so it's not used for enctypting large data or for speed transactions.

			#Hashing :
				a hash function takes input set of data (arbitrary size) and return a fixed size output called hash value ,this is the way of ensuring integrity of messages today .
				hashing uses :
					message digest : by generating a hash of the message and send it with the message ,so the recipient can verify the integrity of it by generating another hash and comapre it with the one attached with the message.
				a hash function should be :
					-Useful :easy to compute the hash value of any given msg
					-Nonreversible:it is computationally infeasable to reverse a hash process .
					-content integrity assurance.
					-Unique : no two different msg can give the same hash
					-Deterministic: the same input always generate the same outpuy.
