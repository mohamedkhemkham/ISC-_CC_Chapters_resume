Understand Data Securtiy
		
		#Data Handling:
			data itself has a life cycel that it goes through from construction to its destruction :
			-->create : creating the knowledge 
			-->Store : storing or recording it in some fashion 
			-->Use : using this knowledge (may be update it) 
			-->Share : share the data with others.
			-->archive: archive it when its not temporarily needed
			-->Destroy: destroy the data when its no longer needed

		#Data Handling Practices :
			data has value and it should be handled properly , so first it should be classified:
			-->classification:
				this classification should dectate rules and restriction about how this information should be used,stored,shared with others.
				Labeling and handel the inforamtion according to the organizational impacts of this information on its CIA

			-->Labeling :
				Security labels are part of implementing controls to protect classified information with a simple way of organizing from low to high .ex: highly restricted : for very sensitive data ,low sensitivity: compromised data with this level could cause minor delays or distruptions... .

			-->Retention :
				Information should be kept as long as it has value .Thus retention periods should be detremined .
				Records Retention :
					policies indicate how long an organization is required to maintain information and assets guarantig that :
						-personnel understand various retention requirements 
						-retention requirements for each information type should be appropriatly documented 
						-system,processes,individuals should retain information according to the required schedule.

			-->Destruction:
				Data remaining on a media after deleting called remanence which is a security concern, to reduce this danger :
					-clear the device or the system , envlolving writing multipe random data over and over (overwirting,zerowriting).
					-purging the device or the system physically to reduce the 'ghost' data left especailly the magnetic devices ,for that degaussing is more effective.
					-physically destruction of the device is the ultimate remedy of data remanence .
