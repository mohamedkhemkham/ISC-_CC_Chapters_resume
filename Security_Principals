the CIA triad :
	C for Confidentiality 
	I for Integrity  
	A for Availability 
#confidentiality allows to permit access to authorized personel and at the same time keep the inforamtion secure.

#inegrity is the property of information wherby its recorded ,used , maintained in a way that ensures its accuracy,consistancy and usefulness.

#availiblity means the data is accessible at the time a user need it .

personally identifiable information (PII): all information linked to a person 
protected health information (PHI): information regardin health status
data integrity (data is not alterd in any way that could cause harm) and system integrity(keeping the same parametre for the system while processing a data)
baseline : documented low level of security
authentication : validating the rightfull onwers of the id by verifying
	--something you know (password)     ->knowledge based
	--something you have (id,card)	    ->token based
	--something you are  (fingerprint,) ->characterisitc based

Mehtods of Authentication :
	--Signle-factor authentication (SFA)
	--Multi-factor authentication (MFA)

#Non-repudiation : the inability to deny taking action (sending message, deleting file).

#Privacy : is the right of sharing,distribution informaition about themselves.

#General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR):an EU law for setting regulation that sites how data should be protected in an international scale.

Risk management
	--asset :something need to be protected
	--vulnerability : gap or weakness in the protection effort
	--threat : someone or something that aims to exploit a vulnerability 

Risk identification :
	--identify risk ro properly communicate it 
	--everyone's job is to identify risk at any level
	--identify it to protect against it 

	#Risk assessment : identify,estimating,prioritize to the organization
	 ->makes a report or a presentation to be given to management

	#Risk treatment : making decision about the best aciton to take according to the risk assessemnt .
		wether to :
			-->avoid    : attepmt to eliminate the risk entirely 
			-->mitigate : actions to reduce or terminate the risk (							  controls,policies.)
			-->transfer : passing the risk to a third party that is willing to 				  help 
			-->accept   : taking no action to reduce the likelihood of the risk 

	#Risk priorities : priorites the risk using (qualitatif/quantatif anaylse)
		one example is to use the risk matrix(propability of risk over its impact)
		-->decision making is always based on the organization priority (one in japan is more susceptible to tsunami then any others)

	#Risk tolerance : entity's appetite for risk
		it's up to executive management/and or the Board of directors to set the risk acceptance level for the organization .

Security Controls :
	management,technical,operational controls that act as a safeguard for the information's CIA.

	#Physical controls : Controls implemented through tangible mechanisms (							 walls,fences,barriers ...)

	#Technical controls (logical conrols): security controls that can be implemented directly into mahcines (ex: settings,configurations ...)

	#Administrative controls (managerial controls):directives, guidelines,they provide frameworks , constaints and standards for human behavior , the scope is the entire organazation .

Governance Elements :
	-->procedures :detailed steps to complete a task 
	-->policies : provide guidance to ensure the support of the standards (					  ex:strategic direction and priorities).
	-->standards : used by governance team to provide a framework for policies 				   procedurs... .(compliance documents)
	-->regulations : laws from the govenment .
	ex : 
		#ISO : international organization for standardization
		#NIST: national insitute of standards and technology
		#IETF: internet engeneering task force 
		#IEEE: institute of electrical and electronics engeneers
