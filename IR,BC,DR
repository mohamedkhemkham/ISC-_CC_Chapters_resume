Incident Response
	Cyber-Attck terms :
		-->Breach: the loss of control,compromise,unauthorized user access or 			   potentialy access PII(personally identifiable information)
		-->Event : any observable occurence in network or system

		-->Exploit:an attack exploit system vulnerabilities

		-->Incedent: event that actually or may jeoparadise the CIA of inforamtoin	
		-->Intrusion:security event or combination of security events in which an 			   itruder gains or attempt to gains access to a system or 					 resource without authorization.
		
		-->Threat : ancy circumstance or event with the potential to adversely 				impact organizations.

		-->vulnerability:weakness in information system,procedure that could be 				 exploited by a threat source

		-->Zero Day : a previous unkown system vulnerability with the potential 			  of exploitation without detection because it doesn't fit in 				any of recongized patterns.
	
	# The Goal of "Incident Response":
		-the priotiry of this plan is to protect life,health and safety,so the primary goal is to be prepared wich require having policies and a response plan will lead the org through the crisis(crisis management).
		-every org should have an "incident response plan" to help maintain the availabelity and surviving.
		-incident response help reduce the impact of an incident so the org can resume its operation sooner .

	# Component of the "Incident Response Plan":
		-incident response policy should refernce a incident response plan the everyone will follow .

		-->Preparation:
			-develop a policy 
			-identify critical data sysetms,single point of failure
			-train stuff on incident response
			-implement the incident response team
			-practice incident identification
			-identify roles and responsibilites
			-plan the coordination for the communication with stakeholders(more than one method of communication)

		-->Detction and Analyse:
			-monitor all possible attack
			-analyse incident using known data	
			-prioritize	incident response
			-Standadize incident documentaion

		-->Containment:
			-gather evidence
			-choose an apropriate containment strategy
			-identify the attacker
			-isolate the attack

		-->Post-Incident Activities:
			-identify evidence that may need to be retained
			-document lessons learned

		Retrospective (preparation,detect and analyse,containment,post-incident)

	#Incident Response Team:
		-with the need of a Security Operation Center(SOC) an org needs a incident response team 
		-team members can assisst with the investigation,assessing damage,collecting evidences,reporting the incident and initaiting recovery procedures .
		-Major responsiblities:
			-->determine the amount and scope of the incident
			-->determine if any confidential inforamtion was compromised
			-->implement any necessary recovery procedures
			-->suprevise the implementation of any additional security measures

Business Continuity
	- The major goal of a Business continuity plan is to sustain business operations while recovering from the incident ex: in the United States if there is a huge Cyber Attack on the network they will use an alternative Military network grid designed for such cases .

	#Components of a Business Continuity Plan :
		-listing team memebers of the BCP
		-immediate responese procedures and checklists
		-notification systems and call trees for alerting personnel that the BCP being enacted
		-guidance for management 
		-how and when to inact the plan
		-contact numbers of critical members of supply chain
	#Business Impact Analysis (BIA):
		analysis of information system's requirements,function,interdependencies used to characterize system priorities in the event of a disruption.
